CREDIT CARD PROJECT

Abstract: This project was made for my Final Project in my Data Mining course. I was allowed to pick any 
dataset I so long as I used data models and the cleaning methods for data that we learned in class. I
choose to use the credit card dataset in UCI's Machine Learning library to see if I could predict whether
the client would default on their next credit card payment based off the features in the dataset.

This project was made using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
