# data_mining_projects
Project listed on Resume

This repository is used to house all my data mining projects. These are projects that use Python and Jupyter Notebook.
I utilize the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy libraries for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and scikit-learn for deeper 
understanding of the data. In some of these projects I go further and implement data models to predict on classifications
whereas in others the focus is on EDA.
