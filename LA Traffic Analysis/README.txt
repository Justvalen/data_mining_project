LA TRAFFIC PROJECT

Abstract: This project was made using LA Traffic data that was provided by Kaggle. I did exploratory data
analysis to find out interesting insights about the data. The first portion of the notebook is me cleaning
the data and shaping into a form that best fits analysis and graph making. The second half I create
graphs showing the insights.

This project was made using Python in Jupyter Notebook
